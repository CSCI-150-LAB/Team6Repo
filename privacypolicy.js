            <h6> Gathering of Personally-Identifiable Information</h6>
            <p class="text-xl-left">Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with Authentic Chef in ways that 
            require Authentic Chef to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 
            Authentic Chef gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at AuthenticChef.com 
            to provide a email address and password. The users engaging in transactions with 
            Authentic Chef are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial 
            information required to process those transactions. In each case, Authentic Chef collects such information only 
            insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Authentic Chef. 
            Authentic Chef does not disclose personally-identifiable information other than as described below. Users can 
            always refuse to supply personally-identifiable information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from 
            engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
            <h6>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifiable Information</h6>
            <p class="text-xl-left">Authentic Chef may disclose potentially personally-identifiable and personally-identifying information 
                only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know such 
                information in order to process it on Authentic Chef’s behalf or to provide services available at the 
                Website, and (ii) have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and 
                affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country by using the Website, you consent to 
                the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. 
                In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. 
                Moreover, if Authentic Chef or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 
                Authentic Chef goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
                 transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any 
                 acquirer of Authentic Chef may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth 
                 in this policy. Otherwise, Authentic Chef will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
