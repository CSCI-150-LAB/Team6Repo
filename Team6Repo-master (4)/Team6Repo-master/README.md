# Authentic Chef

## Project Timeline: 

**09/30/2020 - 11/30/2020**

## Project Description: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine you’re an international student from a foreign country that is traveling to the United States for an opportunity to study at a national university. Months go by and now you’re homesick longing for food that would closely resemble the food that you had in your home country. Unfortunately, no local restaurants can match the quality of your home country’s cooking. However, what if there was a way to get quality home-cooked meals from local chefs that share the same cultural background? 
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WIth **Authentic Chef** that can be possible. Using Authentic Chef, users can either register as a buyer that browses food that other users have posted or a seller that posts their own creations on the website. Another responsibility that would be assigned would be the admin which looks at the requests of the pending sellers and determines if they are eligible. With Authentic Chef, we hope to bring more options to the food market so that people such as international students can feel more comfortable living in another country.

## Project Objectives

There will be three users(**Admin, Sellers**, and **Buyers**): Both users will have a different registration process with each having a username and password. 

### User Priviledges 

**<ins>Seller:</ins>**

* Can edit their availability
* Can post/delete pictures of their food

* Can review buyers
* Can interact with buyers through chat system
* Can categorize the type of food being sold

**<ins>Buyer:</ins>**

### Interface:

The user interface for the Seller, Buyer, and Administrator users are different. A search engine and food category section is required for buyers to navigate through the food options listed on the website. Database must hold and utilize User information, payment protocols, location system and data, and other important operations and data. Back end will be designed to manipulate the database data and operations.
